"""Execute the notebooks of this project, in order, and commit the state of that execution.

Outputs that no single execution produced make a notebook unreadable: the counters say 3, 7,
12, the reader believes they are looking at one run, and the cells they are reading never saw
each other. This script runs each notebook from a clean kernel, so the execution counters
come out as 1..N and every output is from that one pass.

    uv sync --group notebook
    uv run python scripts/run_notebooks.py
    uv run python scripts/run_notebooks.py --check    # fail if a notebook is stale

A notebook writes nothing outside itself. What is published under ``reports/`` comes from
the scripts, because a figure a notebook redrew is a figure no manifest can trace back to
a command.
